# GUI with Python/Tk
This is my repo following the related chapter of the book "1000 Python Examples" by G치bor Szab칩.

Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard GNU/Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python.
